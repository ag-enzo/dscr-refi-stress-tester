## Project: DSCR / Refi Stress-Tester Web App (v1)

### Core Requirements and Goals
- One-page web app for real-estate loan sizing and stress-testing.
- Sizes loans by DSCR and LTV, reports Debt Yield and Year-1 ADS, and visualizes a rate-shock curve (Â±200 bps).
- Deterministic, pure finance logic; no backend or persistence for v1.
- Clean, accessible, and minimalist UI using Next.js (App Router), React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Recharts.
- All code is TypeScript and testable; unit tests for all finance logic.

### Source of Truth for Project Scope
