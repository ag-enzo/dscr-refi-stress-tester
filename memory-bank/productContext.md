## Why this project exists
- To demonstrate real-estate underwriting literacy and coding skill in a professional, deterministic, and testable web app.
- Solves the problem of quickly sizing loans and stress-testing deals for DSCR, LTV, Debt Yield, and rate sensitivity.

## Problems it solves
- Provides a fast, reliable, and accessible tool for deal screening and credit discipline.
- No login, no persistence, no distractionsâ€”just pure finance logic and results.

## How it should work
- User enters deal and loan parameters; app instantly computes all outputs and visualizes the shock curve.
- All validation is soft and user-friendly; errors block outputs but not input.

## User experience goals
- Clean, minimalist, and accessible UI.
- All results update live; errors are clear and actionable.
- No unnecessary complexity or distractions.
