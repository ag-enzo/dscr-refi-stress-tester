## Current Focus
- TASK-020 to TASK-024: Validation error callout, KPI cards, metrics panel, shock chart integration, and data wiring.

## Recent Changes
- Validation error callout implemented and integrated into UI.
- KPI cards and metrics panel components created and styled per plan.
- All outputs (KPIs, metrics, chart) are disabled or show placeholders if validation errors exist.
- ShockChart component created using Recharts, with three series and responsive layout.
- All finance logic functions are wired to UI; outputs update live with user input.

## Next Steps
- Polish formatting (TASK-025+), add formatting helpers, improve UX for empty/error states.
- Add notes/assumptions section if needed.

## Decisions
- Used local state for all inputs; no global store needed for v1.
- Used Recharts for charting as per plan.
- Used shadcn/ui for all cards and panels.
