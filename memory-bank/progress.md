## What works
- All UI layout and logic for TASK-020 to TASK-024 is complete and matches the plan.
- Validation error callout is robust and accessible.
- KPI cards and metrics panel are present, styled, and update with finance logic.
- ShockChart is implemented and live, with correct series and placeholder on error.
- All outputs are disabled or show placeholders if validation errors exist.
