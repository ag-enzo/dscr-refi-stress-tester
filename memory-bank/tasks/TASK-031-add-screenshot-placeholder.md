# TASK-031 - Add /public/screenshot.png placeholder

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-09-10  
**Updated:** 2025-09-10

## Original Request
Add a placeholder screenshot image to `/public/screenshot.png` for documentation and README purposes, as specified in the v1 implementation plan.

## Thought Process
- The README and documentation require a screenshot for clarity and professionalism.
- A placeholder image is needed until a real screenshot is available after UI completion.
- This task is a dependency for documentation and deployment readiness.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Create a placeholder image (e.g., with text "Screenshot Coming Soon")
- [ ] Save it as `public/screenshot.png` in the project root
- [ ] Reference this image in the README and documentation
- [ ] Update the task status and progress log
